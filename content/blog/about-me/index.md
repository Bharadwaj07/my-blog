This is my first post on my blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
I wish to keep on writing new things without fail.


## Ohh Let me tell about Myself.

I don't want to say my name,you can see my name as well.

Its ok I'm Bharadwaj  K R .Yeah curently I live in Bangalore
and I'm not sure how long ,even I'm not sure where am I headed(goal). Basically I wish to be the Physis guys. Unfortunately I'm not.

But I wanted to be part of this morden era.Things are changing so fast that we are trying hard to adopt it .We are not trying to adopt but we are trying fight with the upcomming generations who are far more smarter than us.

So I choose to be the 'CS' guy, yeah I'm getting hold of it, I don't know how good  I am . Eventually I'll try hard to contribute to this changing era .

I think this is enough and I'll wind up

Thank you..
