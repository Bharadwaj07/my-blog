Hello guys ,I'm glad that i'm writing again .


Recently everyone heard about Google's Quantum Computing Supremacy,
I also read lot of articles on Google's Quantum Coputer . 
I'm also fond of quantum technolgy, with in the next 20 to 30 years we will be seeing lots of stuff comming out of Quantum tech.


This time I have wanted to share my knowledge about quantum computing .
I'm not good  at that though  I like physics , the word quantum makes a lot of attraction to it ,as the Quantum tech is uncertain im also uncertain about the topic.

#### Yeah lets dive into the content 

## The word "Quantum" and The Conventional computer.


 Before we dive into the Quantum computing let us see how the conventional computing works. 
 >These conventional computers are buillt on top of the laws of clasical mechanics or in general clasical physics . It is based on the clasical phenomenon of electrical circuit being in a single state in a given time , more in general on and off.
 
  In ordinary computer, it  uses bits these are like tiny switches . we are in this digital age , everyone live every single moment in  their social media,every app you use,every photograph you upload whatever the process is being done by these computers are ultimately made up of millions of bits in some combination of zeros and ones this works great for most of the things .
  
But wait ...

Then why are we fond of this new tech .Can't we solve every problem in the nature by our traditional computing??
Our nature does'nt work the way we wish or we thought of our entire universe is not just on and off.Our nature is full of uncertainity, even our biggest super computers are not good at dealing with these uncertainity. this is the problem.


Thats because over the last century dozens of scientist made a lot of contribution to this new technolgy. What they observed is when you go deep in to the matter or when you start to observe into the small scale of this universe which means matter , weird things start to happen . So they started to develope a whole new theory which discribes these kind of wierdness in the nature,it led to start of this quantum technology. One I would like to remember is Max plank .the father of quantum theory/ quantum physics.
#### We can't predict the future our life is full of posibilities right so does the quantum technology .

## What is quantum computer and how does it works?

Quantum computers are based on the phenomenon of Quantum mechanics such as superposition, entanglement to perform computation
as the number of variables increases for a normal computer or these conventional computers it is difficult to process .these can be handled easily by these quantum computers .

>In quantum commputer instead of bits it uses qubits for processing the information the qubits on not just an on and off .qubits are typically subatomic particls like electron and photon.
Managing these states of the qubit is a big challange for the engineeres .Qubits follow some of the propertis of quantum mechanics , one of those properties is superposition and other is called is entanglement.
>
>Take a coin . If you flip it what will you get  either head or tail only two posibilities ,
but if you spin that coin it got the chance of landing on either head or tail. Until you measure it by stoping the the coin the coin will be in either states i.e head or tail.
>
>Superposition is like spinning the coin, this is the one of the things which makes quntum computer so poweerfull.

If you want to find the shortest distance betweeen the two points , What does the clasical computers do is they will travel every path one by one untill it calculates the shortest distance.
But quantum computer works in differernt way it will check all the possible way at once not one by one and gives the shortest path .

>The other things that qubits does is entanglement : The qubits exist as a pair in a single quantum state .changing the state in one qubit will instantaneously change  the state in the other qubits .
If you flip two coins and the result of one coin is head then the other is also head . In entanglement the two particles are linked together even if they are physically separate .
Its sounds like wierd and like magic though the physicsist still don't fully understands this phenomena .


Quantum computer are not just only fast they are unbelievable they can do the things that we did'nt even dreamt of .They will hold the potentials in genomics to finance .
Most promising applicatioin is simulating the behaviour of matter .
They have the potential to accelerate the developement of artificial intelegence,Medical and can bee usefull in cyber security .They have th ability to break the code and encrypt electronical communications .
Some of the biggest player in the tech are alredy investing in this new tech.



thank you.
